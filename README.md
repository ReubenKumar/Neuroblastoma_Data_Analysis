# ðŸ“Š RNA Data Mortality Prediction Models

This repository contains code for building machine learning models to predict **death from disease** using **FPKM RNA data**. The goal is to leverage gene expression profiles to identify patterns associated with patient survival outcomes.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- **Data Type:** RNA gene expression data  
- **Objective:** Predict whether a patient will die from disease based on RNA profiles  
- **Approach:** Preprocess RNA data, train classification models, and evaluate performance

## ðŸ“‚ Features

- Data preprocessing and normalisation  
- Feature selection from RNA datasets  
- Multiple machine learning model implementations (e.g. Random Forest, XGBoost and KNN.)  
- Performance metrics reporting
